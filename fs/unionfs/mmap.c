/*
 * Unionfs doesn't implement ->writepages, which is OK with the VFS and
 * keeps our code simpler and smaller.  Nevertheless, somehow, our own
 * ->writepage must be called so we can sync the upper pages with the lower
 * pages: otherwise data changed at the upper layer won't get written to the
 * lower layer.
 *
 * Some lower file systems (e.g., NFS) expect the VFS to call its writepages
 * only, which in turn will call generic_writepages and invoke each of the
 * lower file system's ->writepage.  NFS in particular uses the
 * wbc->fs_private field in its nfs_writepage, which is set in its
 * nfs_writepages.  So if we don't call the lower nfs_writepages first, then
 * NFS's nfs_writepage will dereference a NULL wbc->fs_private and cause an
 * OOPS.  If, however, we implement a unionfs_writepages and then we do call
 * the lower nfs_writepages, then we "lose control" over the pages we're
 * trying to write to the lower file system: we won't be writing our own
 * new/modified data from the upper pages to the lower pages, and any
 * mmap-based changes are lost.
 *
 * This is a fundamental cache-coherency problem in Linux.  The kernel isn't
 * able to support such stacking abstractions cleanly.  One possible clean
 * way would be that a lower file system's ->writepage method have some sort
 * of a callback to validate if any upper pages for the same file+offset
 * exist and have newer content in them.
 *
 * This whole NULL ptr dereference is triggered at the lower file system
 * (NFS) because the wbc->for_writepages is set to 1.  Therefore, to avoid
 * this NULL pointer dereference, we set this flag to 0 and restore it upon
 * exit.  This probably means that we're slightly less efficient in writing
 * pages out, doing them one at a time, but at least we avoid the oops until
 * such day as Linux can better support address_space_ops in a stackable
 * fashion.
