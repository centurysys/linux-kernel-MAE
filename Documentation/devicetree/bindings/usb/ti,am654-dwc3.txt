TI AM654 SoC's SuperSpeed DWC3 USB controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain "ti,am654-dwc3"
- reg: address and length of the register set for this device
- interrupts: interrupt line for the device
- power-domains: should contain the phandle to the power domain controller
		 and the power domain ID for the USB controller.

Optional properties:
- syscon-usbctrl: phandle to system controller node for access to
		  USB control register.

Required child node:
A child node must exist to represent the core DWC3 IP block. The name of
the node is not important. The content of the node is defined in dwc3.txt.

Example device nodes:

	dwc3_0: dwc3@4000000 {
		compatible = "ti,am654-dwc3";
		reg = <0x0 0x4000000 0x0 0x4000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges = <0x0 0x0 0x4000000 0x20000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 97 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		dma-coherent;
		status = "disabled";
		power-domains = <&k3_pds 151>;
		syscon-usbctrl = <&scm_conf 0x4000>;

		usb0_phy: phy {
			compatible = "usb-nop-xceiv";
		};

		usb0: usb@10000 {
			compatible = "snps,dwc3";
			reg = <0x10000 0x10000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 100 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <GIC_SPI 100 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 96 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			interrupt-names = "peripheral",
					  "host",
					  "otg";
			maximum-speed = "high-speed";
			dr_mode = "otg";
			usb-phy = <&usb0_phy>;
		};
	};
