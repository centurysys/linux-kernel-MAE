* Texas Instruments K3 NavigatorSS PSI-L (Packet Streaming Interface Link)


The PSI-L is used to transfer words of packet data and control information
between two peer entities via direct connection. There are credits used for flow
control to guarantee that blocking does not occur between threads. Multiple
packet transfers can be ongoing simultaneously across a PSI-L interface each
on a separate logical thread but all sharing a single datapath through time
division multiplexing. Each packet which is transferred is accompanied by a
destination thread ID which indicates the logical destination thread to which
the packet is being sent.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "ti,k3-navss-psilcfg";
- ti,sci:		phandle on TI-SCI compatible System controller node
- ti,sci-dev-id:	TI-SCI device id

Example:

navss256: navss256@30000000 {
	compatible = "ti,k3-navss256","simple-bus";
	...
	psilcfg: psilcfg@30001000 {
		compatible = "ti,k3-navss-psilcfg";

		ti,sci = <&dmsc>;
		ti,sci-dev-id = <118>;
	};
};

client:

dma_ipx: dma_ipx@<addr> {
	...
	ti,psi-proxy = <&psilcfg>;
	...
}
