Texas Instruments System Control Interface (TI-SCI) IRQCHIP
=====================================================================

Some TI SoCs contain a system controller (like the Device Memory and
Security Controller on K3 AM654 SoC) that are responsible for configuring
the SoC IRQ routes between peripherals and host processors and coprocessors.
Communication between the host processor running an OS and the
system controller happens through a protocol called TI System Control
Interface (TI-SCI protocol). For TI SCI details, please refer to the document,
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/keystone/ti,sci.txt

TI-SCI IRQCHIP Node
============================
This irqchip node uses the TI SCI protocol to configure the IRQ routes between
peripherals and host processors and coprocessors. This node must be a child
node of the associated TI-SCI system controller node.

Required properties:
--------------------
 - compatible:		Should be "ti,sci-irq"
 - interrupt-controller:Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
 - #interrupt-cells:	Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
			interrupt source. The value should be 3.
			First cell should contain the TI-SCI device ID
			Second cell should contain the interrupt source id
			within the device
			Third cell specifies the trigger type as defined
			in interrupts.txt in this directory.
 - interrupt-parent:	phandle of irq parent for TISCI irqchip. The parent must
			use the same interrupt-cells format as GIC.

Optional properties:
--------------------
- reg:		Base address and size of the Interrupt Aggregator if available
		inside SoC.
- ia-ids:	Corresponding device ids of the Interrupt Aggregator mentioned
		in reg property.

Example:
--------
The following example demonstrates both a TI-SCI irqchip node and a
consumer (GPIO) on the AM654 SoC.

dmsc: dmsc {
	...
	compatible = "ti,k2g-sci";
	...

	k3_irq: irqchip@33d00000 {
		compatible = "ti,sci-irq";
		interrupt-controller;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
		reg = <0x0 0x33d00000 0x0 0x100000>,
		      <0x0 0x33c00000 0x0 0x40000>,
		      <0x0 0x33c40000 0x0 0x40000>,
		      <0x0 0x2a700000 0x0 0x100000>;
		ia-ids = <179>, <180>, <181>, <189>;
	};
};

gpio0: gpio@600000 {
	...
	interrupt-parent = <&k3_irq>;
	interrupts = <57 256 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<57 257 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<57 258 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
