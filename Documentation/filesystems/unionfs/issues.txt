KNOWN Unionfs ISSUES:
=====================

1. The NFS server returns -EACCES for read-only exports, instead of -EROFS.
   This means we can't reliably detect a read-only NFS export.

2. Modifying a Unionfs branch directly, while the union is mounted, is
   currently unsupported.  We have tested Unionfs under such conditions, and
   fixed any bugs we found (Unionfs comes with an extensive regression test
   suite).  However, it may still be possible that changes made to lower
   branches directly could cause cache incoherency which, in the worst case,
   may case an oops.  We are currently addressing this problem for Unionfs
   and also generically for all stackable file systems, by handing mmap and
   introducing small VFS/MM changes that would allow a file system to handle
   cache coherency correctly.

3. Unionfs should not use lookup_one_len() on the underlying f/s as it
   confuses NFS.  Currently, unionfs_lookup() passes lookup intents to the
   lower file-system, this eliminates part of the problem.  The remaining
   calls to lookup_one_len may need to be changed to pass an intent.
