KNOWN Unionfs 2.0 ISSUES:
=========================

1. The NFS server returns -EACCES for read-only exports, instead of -EROFS.
   This means we can't reliably detect a read-only NFS export.

2. Unionfs should not use lookup_one_len() on the underlying f/s as it
   confuses NFSv4.  Currently, unionfs_lookup() passes lookup intents to the
   lower file-system, this eliminates part of the problem.  The remaining
   calls to lookup_one_len may need to be changed to pass an intent.  We are
   currently introducing VFS changes to fs/namei.c's do_path_lookup() to
   allow proper file lookup and opening in stackable file systems.
