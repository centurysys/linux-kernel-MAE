Unionfs is a stackable unification file system, which can appear to merge
the contents of several directories (branches), while keeping their physical
content separate.  Unionfs is useful for unified source tree management,
merged contents of split CD-ROM, merged separate software package
directories, data grids, and more.  Unionfs allows any mix of read-only and
read-write branches, as well as insertion and deletion of branches anywhere
in the fan-out.  To maintain Unix semantics, Unionfs handles elimination of
duplicates, partial-error conditions, and more.

# mount -t unionfs -o branch-option[,union-options[,...]] none MOUNTPOINT

The available branch-option for the mount command is:

	dirs=branch[=ro|=rw][:...]

specifies a separated list of which directories compose the union.
Directories that come earlier in the list have a higher precedence than
those which come later. Additionally, read-only or read-write permissions of
the branch can be specified by appending =ro or =rw (default) to each
directory.

Syntax:

	dirs=/branch1[=ro|=rw]:/branch2[=ro|=rw]:...:/branchN[=ro|=rw]

Example:

	dirs=/writable_branch=rw:/read-only_branch=ro
