        tristate "QCOM General Serial Bus Interface"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        select MFD_SYSCON
        help
          Say y here to enable GSBI support.  The GSBI provides control
          functions for connecting the underlying serial UART, SPI, and I2C
          devices to the output pins.

config QCOM_PM
	bool "Qualcomm Power Management"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM && !ARM64
	select QCOM_SCM
	help
	  QCOM Platform specific power driver to manage cores and L2 low power
	  modes. It interface with various system drivers to put the cores in
	  low power modes.

config QCOM_SMEM
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager (SMEM)"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on HWSPINLOCK
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager.
	  The driver provides an interface to items in a heap shared among all
	  processors in a Qualcomm platform.

config QCOM_SMD
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver (SMD)"
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver
	  providing communication channels to remote processors in Qualcomm
	  platforms.

config QCOM_SMD_RPM
	tristate "Qualcomm Resource Power Manager (RPM) over SMD"
	depends on QCOM_SMD && OF
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Resource Power Manager system found in the Qualcomm 8974 based
	  devices.

	  This is required to access many regulators, clocks and bus
	  frequencies controlled by the RPM on these devices.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for the Qualcomm RPM as a
	  module. This will build a module called "qcom-smd-rpm".

config MSM_GLINK
	bool "Generic Link (G-Link)"
	help
	 G-Link is a generic link transport that replaces SMD.  It is used
	 within a System-on-Chip (SoC) for communication between both internal
	 processors and external peripherals.  The actual physical transport
	 is handled by transport plug-ins that can be individually enabled and
	 configured separately.

config MSM_GLINK_LOOPBACK_SERVER
	bool "Generic Link (G-Link) Loopback Server"
	help
	 G-Link Loopback Server that enable loopback test framework to test
	 and validate the G-Link protocol stack. It support both local and
	 remote clients to configure the loopback server and echo back the
	 data received from the clients.

config MSM_GLINK_SMEM_NATIVE_XPRT
	depends on MSM_SMEM
	depends on MSM_GLINK
	bool "Generic Link (G-Link) SMEM Native Transport"
	help
	 G-Link SMEM Native Transport is a G-Link Transport plug-in.  It allows
	 G-Link communication to remote entities through a shared memory
	 physical transport.  The nature of shared memory limits this G-Link
	 transport to only connecting with entities internal to the
	 System-on-Chip.

config MSM_GLINK_PKT
	bool "Enable device interface for GLINK packet channels"
	depends on MSM_GLINK
	help
	 G-link packet driver provides the interface for the userspace
	 clients to communicate over G-Link via device nodes.
	 This enable the usersapce clients to read and write to
	 some glink packets channel.

config MSM_IPC_ROUTER_GLINK_XPRT
	depends on MSM_GLINK
	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	bool "MSM GLINK XPRT Layer"
	help
	 GLINK Transport Layer that enables IPC Router communication within
	 a System-on-Chip(SoC). When the GLINK channels become available,
	 this layer registers a transport with IPC Router and enable
	 message exchange.

config MSM_SMEM
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on HWSPINLOCK_QCOM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory (SMEM)"
	help
	 Support for the shared memory interface between the various
	 processors in the System on a Chip (SoC) which allows basic
	 inter-processor communication.
