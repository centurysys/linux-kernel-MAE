config WLAN_VENDOR_MORSE
	tristate "Morse Micro driver"
	help
	  If you have a wireless card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if WLAN_VENDOR_MORSE

config MORSE_SDIO
	bool "SDIO support"
	help
	  This driver supports wireless cards connected over SDIO.

	  The kernel device tree must be configured appropriately
	  for the host/device interface.
	  Both SDIO and SPI drivers may be enabled simultaneously.

config MORSE_SDIO_ALIGNMENT
	int "Alignment requirements for bulk SDIO reads/writes"
	default 2
	range 2 8
	help
	  Number of bytes to align data buffers for bulk SDIO transactions. Some hosts have
	  specific alignment requirements for DMA, use this setting to
	  adjust the alignment required.

	  Must be a power of 2.

config MORSE_SPI
	bool "SPI support"
	help
	  This driver supports wireless cards connected over SPI.

	  The kernel device tree must be configured appropriately
	  for the host/device interface.
	  Both SDIO and SPI drivers may be enabled simultaneously.

config MORSE_SPI_RK3288
	bool "SPI support for Rockchip 3288"
	default n
	depends on MORSE_SPI
	help
	  This driver supports the Rockchip 3288 SPI interface.

	  Special handling is required for this board because initialisation
	  of the Morse chip in SPI mode requires a handshake with the SPI CS
	  line held high, which is not supported in the Rockchip driver.

	  When enabled, the Morse SPI driver must be brought up before the
	  Rockchip SPI driver.

config MORSE_USER_ACCESS
	bool "User space access support"
	help
	  Enable user-space access to wireless cards.

config MORSE_VENDOR_COMMAND
	bool "Morse vendor commands"
	default n
	help
	  Allow vendor-specific commands from userspace applications such as iw.

config MORSE_COUNTRY
	string "Country code for regulatory compliance"
	default "AU"
	help
	  Two-character country code.

config MORSE_DEBUG_MASK
	int "Debug mask"
	default 8
	help
	  Set the Morse driver debug level.
	  Choose any combination of 8 (Error), 4 (Warning), 2 (Informational) and 1 (Debug).
	  The minimum debug level applied is 8 (Error).
	  Note that increasing debug level can impact performance.

config MORSE_SDIO_RESET_TIME
	int "Time to wait after SDIO reset (ms)"
	default 400
	range 0 400
	help
	  Reduce the wait time after SDIO reset to reduce boot time.
	  Can cause instability and load failure if set too low for the device.

config MORSE_POWERSAVE_MODE
	int "Power Save mode"
	default 2
	range 0 2
	help
	  Choose 0 to disable Power Save, 1 to enable the Power Save protocol, or 2 to fully enable
	  Power Save mode.

config MORSE_DHCP_OFFLOAD
	bool "Offload DHCP lease renewal processing to the firmware"
	default n
	help
	  When enabled, DHCP lease renewal and discovery is handled by the firmware, with no
	  interaction with the host device. Only basic DHCP options are supported.

config MORSE_ARP_OFFLOAD
	bool "Offload ARP packet handling to the firmware"
	default n
	help
	  When enabled, the firmware will directly respond to ARP requests for the wireless
	  interface's IP address, with no interaction with the host device. All other ARP requests
	  are ignored.

config MORSE_WATCHDOG_RESET_DEFAULT_DISABLED
	bool "Disable driver reset from watchdog by default"
	default y
	help
	  When not set, if the watchdog detects an unrecoverable error, the default behaviour is to
	  reset the firmware. When set, the default behaviour is to not reset the firmware.
	  This setting can be overridden when loading the driver, by setting the enable_watchdog
	  parameter.

config MORSE_DISABLE_CHANNEL_SURVEY
	bool "Disable channel survey"
	default n
	help
	  When set, the firmware will not perform channel surveys.
