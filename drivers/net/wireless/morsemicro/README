Cross-compile driver 
--------------------

To cross-compile, you will need a compiled kernel to build against.

To compile the driver, make sure your cross-compiler is in your PATH.

Then build the driver:

(Update ARCH, CROSS_COMPILE and KERNEL_SRC as appropriate)

    make MORSE_TRACE_PATH=`pwd` ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- KERNEL_SRC=~/linux CONFIG_WLAN_VENDOR_MORSE=m CONFIG_MORSE_SDIO=y CONFIG_MORSE_USER_ACCESS=y
